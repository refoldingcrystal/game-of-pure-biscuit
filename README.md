# Game of Pure Biscuit

My entry for Brackey Game Jam 2025.2

Game is basically a implementation of GOPS (Game of Pure Strategy), but with biscuits!

## How to play

Objective: Get the most biscuits

1. Each player gets one suit of cards
2. Each round consists of these steps:
    1. Random number of biscuits (1 - 13) is placed on the table as a prize
    2. Each player chooses one card
    3. Player who choose a higher card gets all of the biscuits and the cards are discarded
        1. If both cards have the same value, number of biscuits increases
